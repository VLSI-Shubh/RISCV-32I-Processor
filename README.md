# RISCV-32I-Processor

This is the branch that deals with the continuous efforts of single cycle execution. All the latest, working files can be found in the main branch; this branch only focuses on the single cycle execution.

Never fork or clone this branch as it is constantly under progress, and the modules might not perform the way you want them to.

The current version of the setup is working and can be used to execute individual as well as simple straightforward tasks as one.

Work is ongoing to improve and bring more versatility to handle more complex tasks.
