# Pipelined Execution Project

## Project Status
This project is currently in the planning phase. No implementation has been public done yet, I have been working on it but running into constant issues.

## Project Goal
To design and implement a 5-stage pipelined CPU architecture capable of executing the RV32I instruction set.

## Planned Features
- Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-back pipeline stages
- Hazard detection and data forwarding mechanisms to handle data hazards
- Static branch prediction to improve pipeline flow
- Integration of instruction and data caches for optimized memory access
- Pipeline registers between stages to hold intermediate data and control signals

## Next Steps
- Define datapath and control logic for each pipeline stage
- Implement hazard detection and forwarding units
- Develop and integrate cache modules
- Test and verify pipeline functioning with sample RISC-V programs

## Contribution
Contributions and suggestions are welcome to help shape the design and implementation.
